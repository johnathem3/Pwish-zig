# pwish-rs
Nobody rewrote me with Rust from scratch so I could be more memory safe, so I did.

## Building
The good old Rust will be sufficient, it uses [colored](https://docs.rs/colored/latest/colored/) as it's only dependency anyway. After git clonning just use `cargo run`. It should be at `../target/debug/pwish-rs`

## Sources
At [main.rs](https://gitlab.com/pwish/pwish-rs/-/blob/main/src/main.rs)

## Binary
At [releases](https://gitlab.com/pwish/pwish-rs/-/releases).

## Check out: 
[go-projects](https://github.com/isa-programmer/go-projects) by Isa-Programmer, it has the original pwish-go, the program pwish-rs is a port of.
